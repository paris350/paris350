                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>Ella Jade Taylor - Owner & Senior Partner</p>
        Working out has always been a passion.  Playing sports all my life including track and field, basketball and tennis so having a business was just the natural next step.  After working in corporate America, I realized I wanted to help people realize their best self.  I went back to school and received my degree in sports medicine.  I then received my personal trainer certification from ACSM.  I have worked with some of the best in the business learning every step of the way.  My philosophy is simple, "what you put in is what you will get out of your efforts".  Always do your nest and the results will clearly emerge.
