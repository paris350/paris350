        <div class="container">Florence is one of the most beautiful in Italy or the world.  Many people in this charming city do not speak English. Here are some places which I found help me to enjoy my stay in Florence and can't wait until I can return again.</div>
        
     <h4>Must See</h4>
        <img src="images/Duomo_Italy.img.jpg" alt="Image of Duomo Cathedral">
        
        <div>One of the highlights of Florence is the Duomo which means Italian Cathedral in Italian.  It is massive to put it mildly.  Its archetecture is undescribable.  But I think its the contrast in its outside color scheme which makes it the most impressive.  Known officially as Santa Maria del Fiore (known as the Virgin of the Flower, an allusion to the lily, the symbol of Florence). The first brick was laid for this cathedral in 1296 and completed in 1884. Admission is free and mass is held every Sunday.  Here is some additional information <a href="http://www.duomofirenze.it/attivita/liturgical.htm"> www.duomofirenze,it/attivita/liturgical.htm</a> This is a central meeting place and great for people watching.  All that visit Florence will pass through and take pictures of the building and sit in the piazza outside.       
        </div>
        
     <h4>Shopping</h4> 
        <img src="images/pontevecchiobridge.img.jpg">
        
        <div>Italy is known for its many designers and craftmanship.  Florence is a shopper's heaven!  So many small shops with quality clothes and jewelry to choose from.  A well known destination for the best Italian jewelry is located walking distance from the Duomo.  It is the many small shops that line this pedestrian bridge called Ponte Vecchio.  This bridge is across the Arno River in Florence.  You can find from the inexpensive the the extravagant in gold jewelry and gemstones.</div>
        
        <br>If you are looking for designer clothing make a trip to The Mall <a href=https://www.themall.it/en/outlet-italy/homepage.html>https://www.themall.it/en/outlet-italy/homepage.html </a>
        Check with your hotel concierge for shuttle buses from your hotel or other popular pickup locations within the city.</br>
        
        
   <h4>Food</h4> 
        <img src="images/pizza.img.jpg">
        
        <div>After having an authentic dining experience, travelers will leave Italy with a much better grasp on what Italian food is. If you want a fine dining experience and authentically Italian, I recommend 4Leoni Restaurant <a href=http://www.4leoni.com>http://www.4leoni.com/</a>".  The food is delicious and they have received some impressive reviews and accolades. Italian cuisine is one of the most sought after cuisines in Europe.  From the outdoor stalls to the fine dining restaurants, Italian cuisine is based on fresh seasonal ingredients cooked simply with extra care.  There are so many dining choices as well as some of the best coffee in the world.</div>
